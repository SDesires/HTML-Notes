# HTML-Notes

Everyone needs a starting point when they learn, and learning HTML is no different. Hopefully this repository can serve as a resource and an aid to those starting out and make sense to those that are confused. Feel free to clone, make pull requests, even add any information that you need. I will also be adding cheatsheets to add some visual aids as well.

<h2>HTML Samples</h2>

This is where you will find sample HTML Codes for reference.
<ul>
  <li><b>index.html</b> - A base HTML page with comments within the code that you can copy if you need to start one. Includes a line to link an external CSS and JS page.</li>
  <li><b>humble beginnings.html</b> - a simple webpage made entirely in html to give some examples of what it can do.</li>
</ul>

<br>
Happy Coding!
