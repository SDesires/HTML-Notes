# HTML-Notes

Everyone needs a starting point when they learn, and learning HTML is no different. Hopefully this repository can serve as a resource and an aid to those starting out and make sense to those that are confused. Feel free to clone, make pull requests, even add any information that you need. I will also be adding cheatsheets to add some visual aids as well.

Happy Coding!
