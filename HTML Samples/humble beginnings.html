    <!-- I see you looking at my code all creepy like! That's okay, hopefully you are doing so in order to learn and if I succeed in helping at least one person understand the basics of Html, then it was well worth the effort writing this (other then for practice of course) -->

        <h1>Humble Beginnings</h1>
        
        <p>Everyone has to start from somewhere and usually that 'somewhere' is a blank slate with big aspirations and very little knowledge on how to achieve them. Through persistance, dedication, a few doors of opportunity <i>(whether self-made or pure luck</i>) and massive amounts of caffiene, one can accomplish almost anything.</p>

        <p>Granted, this page isn't very pretty, but to be fair, this is just a simple HTML page. As anyone learning Frontend Development can tell you, the 'pretty' stuff is within the styling of a webpage, and that uses a whole different language alltogether. You guessed it, I'm talking about CSS. But that is another topic for another time. For this page, I'm just going to use the bare bones, the 'starting point' of it all.</p>

        <p>A lot of the styling that used to be done in simple HTML, is now done with CSS, but that doesn't mean that HTML is lacking in it's own right.</p>
        
        <h2>Here are some examples of HTML's simple structures:</h2>

        <h3>Lists</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Html makes a list nice and orderly.</li>
            <li>There are two types of lists that  you can create with it.</li>
            <li>This list is called an 'unordered' list.</li>
            <li>You can tell by the dots or 'bullets' next to each item on the list.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>This is the start of an ordered list.</li>
            <li>See how each item is numbered?</li>
            <li>This makes it easier to know in which order you need to do something if need be.</li>
            <li>This type of list can also be used to count items or whatever you need it to do!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Did you also know that HTML has not one, not two, but <b>SIX</b> Heading sizes?? They range in size from the first one that I used on this page and go all the way to the one I am going to put after this paragraph.</p>
        <h6>This Heading Is Really Small!! It's a Heading 6.</h6>
        <p>If you are looking at client-side of this page, then you don't see all the other stuff that I've added into the code as well. For example, for the links on the nav (yup that's actually a nav bar, looks kinda weird unstyled doesn't it?) I have it in the code that if they were clicked on, it would open up a page in a new tab on your browser.</p>
        <p>There are even tags for if you want something to stay the exact same way that you type it while you type the code. For example this poem is how I typed on my code editor:</p>

        <pre>Roses are  red.
               Violets are blue.
                  I enjoy writing Html,
                     And so will you!
        </pre>
        <p>You can even make simple buttons with Html!</p>
         <button>I'm A button!</button>  
<br>
<p>Don't forget forms too!
<form action="post">
    <label>Favorite Color:</label>
        <input type="color"> Pick your favorite color!
        <!-- usually there is a submit button but since I don't have this page really linking to any other one, I purposely left it out of the code. -->
</form>

<p>There is so much more that Html can do that people don't realize when they first learn it, and even though it's just the skeleton of a webpage, it's still good to familiarize yourself with it to where you can make a simple silly page just like this one, even if it's just for practice. </p>

<p>Have fun and happy coding!</p>
